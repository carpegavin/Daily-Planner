   # The Number 1 Daily-Planner

## https://carpegavin.github.io/Daily-Planner/

## The goal of this project was to do the following:
- Create a calendar application that allows a user to input hourly events creating a daily planner so that their time may be managed effectively.

## The requirements to complete this project were as follows:
- display current date at the top of the calendar
- when user scrolls down, they are presented with standard business hours timeblocks
- the timeblocks are color coded to indicate whether the event is past, present, or future
- timeblocks are accepting of inputs
- the save button saves timeblock data to local storage
- saved events must persist after page refresh

## To accomplich these criteria, I implemented the following:
- created this repo with a readme.md
- set the HTML framework with rows for each hour with a save button
- Javascript
   - added a moment() for the current time
